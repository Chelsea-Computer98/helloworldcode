<h3> An introduction </h3>
<p> I went to Josephinum Academy of the Sacred Hearts and graduated valedictorian with International Baccalaureate Diploma. In 2018, when I enrolled in Dominican University I unleashed my creative capacity and academic curiosity. I had great joy in teaching my community and hosting workshops. In 2019, I cooperated with a classmate to used Simone de Beauvoir's philosophy of motherhood to analyze the current Pro and Anti abortion legislation. I hosted another workshop to teach false information and social media literacy at the Oak Park Public Library.
Due to my status as an international student, I have studied in China, United States, and Canada. In my past time, I liked to cycle around the neighborhoods in my area and read novels. My interests in reading and writing prompted me to start my own blog: inkwelltalks.wordpress.com One of the poems I published end up winning the 2017 Gwendolyn Brooks Youth Poetry Award.
In my free time, I enjoy visiting different religious institutions. Even though I do not subscribe any faith, I enjoy talking with others about their journey and faith background. I tried to stay as involved as I can because I want to make contributions to my community all my life. I volunteered with many organizations from the Chicago Botanic Garden, Tzu Chi Buddhist Foundation, Alliance Francaise de Chicago, etc. I helped out by cleaning up, babysitting, and sometimes even translating.
My appreciation for the arts and desire to help others brought me into journalism, and I wish to use my skills and expertise to deliver information to areas that needed the most. I am most passionate to report to those who lack communication, whether through economic means or political hardships, I think it is important to make everyone's stories heard, because then we could have a better understanding of our time and better appreciation of what it means to be human.
I heard once that a journalist only achieves good writing when he/she writes all the way to the doorsteps. As I continue to write and cover various stories, I realized the connections in my community. I also started to see that people generally perceive information through visual storytelling (such as film) and engaging writing (such as blog, podcast, or articles). This is something I strive to perfect during my studies and personal experiences of my career.
